O'Hare et al have studied the relationship between government revenue and the determinants of health and mortality and found it to be significant and have used these estimates to develop the Global Lives Improved and Saved Tool (GLIST).  

This tool helps the user to have a sense of the potential for improvement in coverage of the third, fourth and sixth Sustainable Development Goal targets if governments have additional revenue. 

This interactive map was realised with D3.

This repository is superseded by the [GRADE tool](https://github.com/stuwilmur/GRADE).
